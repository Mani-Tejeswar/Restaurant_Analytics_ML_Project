### 👤 Author: Mani Tejeswar Reddy

### 📁 Submission ID: CTIA1C157196

### 🏢 Organization: Cognifyz - *Where Data Meets Intelligence*

## 📦 Project Overview

This project involves solving four distinct data science tasks using a restaurant dataset. The tasks span regression modeling, recommendation systems, classification, and geospatial analysis — each designed to explore different facets of data preprocessing, machine learning, and insights generation.

---

## 📁 Contents

* `Dataset .csv` — The dataset containing restaurant-related features.
* `Task1.ipynb` — Predict restaurant ratings using regression models.
* `Task2.ipynb` — Build a restaurant recommendation system.
* `Task3.ipynb` — Classify restaurants based on cuisine types.
* `Task4.ipynb` — Perform geospatial analysis on restaurant locations.

## 📘 Tasks Breakdown

### ✅ Task 1: Predict Restaurant Ratings (Regression)

**Objective:** Build a machine learning model to predict the aggregate rating of a restaurant based on other features.

**Steps:**

* Preprocess the dataset (handle missing values, encode categorical variables).
* Split the data into training/testing sets.
* Train regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Tree).
* Evaluate using MSE and R² score.
* Analyze influential features affecting ratings.

📂 *Notebook:* `Task1.ipynb`

### ✅ Task 2: Restaurant Recommendation System

**Objective:** Create a content-based restaurant recommendation system based on user preferences.

**Steps:**

* Preprocess dataset and encode relevant features.
* Define recommendation criteria (e.g., cuisine, city, price range).
* Implement a cosine similarity-based filtering approach.
* Generate and evaluate recommendations for sample users.

📂 *Notebook:* `Task2.ipynb`

### ✅ Task 3: Cuisine Classification (Classification)

**Objective:** Develop a classification model to predict restaurant cuisines.

**Steps:**

* Handle missing data and encode features.
* Train classifiers (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest).
* Evaluate using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall.
* Identify model biases or performance issues across cuisine categories.

📂 *Notebook:* `Task3.ipynb`

---

### ✅ Task 4: Geospatial Analysis

**Objective:** Perform a geographical analysis of restaurants using latitude and longitude data.

**Steps:**

* Visualize restaurant distribution on maps.
* Group and analyze by city/locality.
* Derive statistics like average ratings or price by area.
* Extract meaningful location-based insights.

📂 *Notebook:* `Task4.ipynb`
